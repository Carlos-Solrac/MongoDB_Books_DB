## About this project

This project demonstrates proficiency in searching a MongoDB, using an index search, and incorporating both into the Document App from assignment 7.

The primary program functions are as follows:

1. **Add a Book**: You can add a new book to the database, providing information such as title, author, publisher, ISBN, publication year, and more.

2. **Update a Book**: This script allows you to update the metadata of an existing book in the database, including its genre, length, and ratings.

3. **Display Books**: You can display all the books in the database, view a specific book's details, or delete a book from the database.

Also included is the script to create the database and two additional scripts showing proficiency in searching and using indexes with MongoDB.
